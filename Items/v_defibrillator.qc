// Once you set the FPS or other stuff in all the following $animation lines below, make of copy of them and change the prefix of the copy from A_ to AL_!
// That way your non_layer and _layer sequences will have the same settings, while also preventing a nasty bug from appearing.
// I could have set these up for you beforehand, but i myself always edit the FPS, so i would always need to edit two lines for that. Just duping and renaming is quicker.

//	Defib has no helping hand anims. You could add them, but it will look weird for your friends when you host with a mod that has em.
//	Something to do with trying to play anims that don't exist for the others.
//	I'll add them here anyways in case you want to use it. Uncomment the $sequences below aswell.
