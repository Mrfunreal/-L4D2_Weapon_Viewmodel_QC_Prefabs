// Swinghard animations are not used in L4D2. But mods can unlock them. You might want to animate them anyways. Who knows.
// Secondary_Swing is the "push back" animation to stumble the CI.

// Once you set the FPS or other stuff in all the following $animation lines below, make of copy of them and change the prefix of the copy from A_ to AL_!
// That way your non_layer and _layer sequences will have the same settings, while also preventing a nasty bug from appearing.
// I could have set these up for you beforehand, but i myself always edit the FPS, so i would always need to edit two lines for that. Just duping and renaming is quicker.

//	Riotshield has no helping hand anims. You could add them, but it will look weird for your friends when you host with a mod that has em.
//	Something to do with trying to play anims that don't exist for the others.
//	I'll add them here anyways in case you want to use it. Uncomment the $sequences below aswell.
//	$Animation a_hh_ext				anims/hh_ext			FPS 30 frames  0 19	//first frames of this anim.	//	"Helping Hand" and "Item Extend" could be the same pose. Makes animating quicker.

// $SEQUENCES
// Edit Fadein/Fadeout and animation events if you want.
// All sequences using activity ACT_VM_HITLEFT, HITCENTER, HITRIGHT are both the "timer" and the "visible" sequence. Making their _Layer counterpart useless.
// These now useless _layers are marked with "HIDDEN //!". The other Hidden sequences are the non_layers you don't need to see in HLMV. (Except for lookpose)
// I took the liberty to add "Subtract a_idle 0 Delta" to every visible $sequence to make blending happen. Delete where you don't want it.
//-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//Because the riotshield is dropped so early in development, it doesn't have lookposes. I'll just add them to the bottom so you still got them.
