// $SEQUENCES
// Edit Fadein/Fadeout and animation events if you want.
// All sequences using activity ACT_VM_HITLEFT, HITCENTER, HITRIGHT are both the "timer" and the "visible" sequence. Making their _Layer counterpart useless.
// These now useless _layers are marked with "HIDDEN //!". The other Hidden sequences are the non_layers you don't need to see in HLMV. (Except for lookpose)
// I took the liberty to add "Subtract a_idle 0 Delta" to every visible $sequence to make blending happen. Delete where you don't want it.
